## Comic Post Brainstorming
"Life at a Tech Startup," a web-toon
Genre: Comedy, Slice-of-life

My Desk
1. Welcome to the company!
2. ~* goes out to lunch with team ~*
3. ~* comes back to desk ~*
4. "Where did my stuff go?" "Oh, you got moved to another floor, they're re-organizing again"
Everyday surprises of working at a scaling company.

Slack
1. There are many channels in slack. I pretty much mute them all, except for the essentials.
2. Like the office-e channel. Where they post snacks for the building.
3. Or the engineering lunch channel, where hungry engineers make lunch teams.
4. Or quote of the day, where no-context quotes are posted.
5. Or the cat channel, where cat gifs are posted.
6. Or the Tony18PackSightings channel, where we post pictures of a man we've named Tony who buys 18 packs of beer and walks past our building on the regular.
7. Clearly, I've got my priorities straight.
Don't worry, I subscribe to important channels too.

TVs
1. "Nice, new TVs. Do these have Chromecast already?"
2. "Yeah, we're channel e2e!"
3. "Cool. Well, I'm going back to my desk"
4. * working *
5. Suddenly, memes start playing on the TV
This company believes in freedom, and freedom means taking over unused televisions.

Attack from Customer Support
1. Mr. Stone is switching departments from CS to QA
2. He sets his stuff down on his desk
3. All seems Well
4. Suddenly, all of CS nerfs QA
5. "This is for taking Stone away from us!!!"
6. The war has begun
Nerf guns are a workplace fad I pray never goes away.

First Impressions
1. Smart-looking dude goes in for an interview, walks past my desk
2. I continue to Work
3. Suddenly, I notice doge-rocket on Chromecast tv
4. The whole room gathers around and laughs
5. "What's the interviewee going to think??"
6. "That this is a great company"
7. Interviewee is laughing at memes with us
I promise we actually work too.

Chromecast, part 2
1. In a QA meeting.
2. Mike Stone starts laughing.
3. I look over my shoulder.
4. "Mike Stone Sucks" is written on a document and casted to the TV outside
5. I am stifling laughter, Boss is unaware
6. Various memes continue to play on TV
Chromecast is too much power and I love it.
